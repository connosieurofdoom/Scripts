From our initial review we discovered that most studies are geared towards analysing depression PTSD or anxiety Other disorders do not get as much attention as these three We hope this review would help in spreading awareness about the other disorders even a little The field of digital counselling and chatbots for therapy has seen a boom since the recent COVID19 crisis when face to face interaction between people had declined and social media interactions had increased We hope this review aids future study towards diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders The proposed model for detecting mental health disorders is expected to account for semantic dependencies in a seemingly unstructured environment to identify potential patients We hope understanding context would aid the model in better diagnosis It is our expectation that the chatbot would overcome the limitation of previous chatbots which were claimed to lack intelligence or occasionally spout gibberish In addition we expect the chatbot to aid patients facing mental health disorders to seek treatment while overcoming the stigma against such disorders of the mind that is still prevalent in society
